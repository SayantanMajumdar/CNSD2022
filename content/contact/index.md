## How to Reach Pune*
Pune is well connected by air, rail and road to other major cities in India. The airport is located in Lohegaon. When arriving by train or bus, you can alight at either Pune Junction (main railway station and bus stand) or at Shivajinagar station / bus stand. Another option, particularly for international visitors, is to travel to Mumbai and then take a taxi, bus or train to Pune.

### How to reach IISER Pune*
IISER Pune is located in between Pashan and Baner areas, in the north-western part of Pune city. It is about three kilometers from Pune University circle. If you take Baner road from Pune University circle, you will reach the Baner Gate of IISER Pune on your left, after about 3 km (between ITI Road junction and Someshwar Wadi junction). On the pashan side, National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) is a known landmark very close to IISER. Going from Pune University towards Pashan, the Pashan Gate of IISER Pune is located about 200 metres from NCL gate, on the same side of the road.

Pune Municipal Transport buses halt at Baner Road opposite to Baner Gate and at the Panchavati bus stop located just opposite to the Pashan gate. We would advise that if you are coming by autorickshaw or taxi, please get the vehicle inside the campus as it can be a fairly long walk from the gate with luggage.
